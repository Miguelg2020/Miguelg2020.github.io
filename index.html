  <h2>Hii Guyz</h2>
    <p>My name is Jose Miguel Padilla Gonzalez,Im 23 years young & i was born in Morelia,Michoacan.</p>
    <p>I was raised in Atlanta,GA since the age of two and lived there for about twenty years.</p>
    <p>I like going running and doing excercise to stay healthy, as well as playing paintball with my friends and going hunting when i go out to the country in Michoacan.</p>
    <p>My main priorities in life are my little brothers and making sure they are always okay.</p>


    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I started attending school at the age of three, where i was enrolled into Lee Street Elemtary School in Joneboro,GA.
    I attended Lee Street Elementary for about six years until i finally got into Rex Mill Middle School to study three more years.</p>

    <p>Once i finally graduated from Rex Mill Middle School i became a freshman at Mt.Zion High School were i attended for one year before dropping out so i could take care of and provide for my family.
<p>I always dreamed of becoming a Master Electrician when i was younger but because of the lack of resources i never got the chance to follow my dream.</p>
